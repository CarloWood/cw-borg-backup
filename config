# *** INIT ***

# See https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/init.html#encryption-modes
# Possible values:
#   none                : No encryption and no authentication. Use SHA256 as
#                         chunk ID hash.
#   repokey             : Use AES-CTR-256 for encryption and HMAC-SHA256 for
#                         authentication in an encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)
#                         construction. The chunk ID hash is HMAC-SHA256 as
#                         well (with a separate key).
#   keyfile             : Idem.
#   repokey-blake2      : Use BLAKE2b-256 instead of HMAC-SHA256 for authenti-
#                         cation. The chunk ID hash is a keyed BLAKE2b-256 hash.
#   keyfile-blake2      : Idem.
#   authenticated       : Use no encryption, but authenticates repository
#                         contents through the same HMAC-SHA256 hash as the
#                         repokey and keyfile modes (it uses it as the chunk
#                         ID hash). The key is stored like repokey.
#   authenticated-blake2: Like authenticated, but uses the keyed BLAKE2b-256
#                         hash from the other blake2 modes.
